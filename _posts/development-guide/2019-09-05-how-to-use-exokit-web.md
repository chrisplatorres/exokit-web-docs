This page will cover how to create a standalone page with XR iframes (`xr-iframe`). You can view the full [boilerplate code on GitHub](https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit-web/tree/master/boilerplate).

# Elements

## <xr-engine>

`xr-engine` the new top-level element for Exokit Web. If you're familiar with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), this is similar in concept to `<a-scene>`.

`xr-engine` represents an instance of the WebXR engine running in the browser. When you add it to your DOM, it acts as a `<canvas>` window through which you see the WebXR world in the page.

### Create the tag

For compatibility reasons, there are several ways to make an xr-engine:

<b>1.</b> Declare it in your HTML directly:
```html
<xrengine>
  <!-- WebXR site goes here -->
</xr-engine>
```
<b>2.</b> Declare it in the HTML with a `src`: `<xr-engine src="app.html"></xr-engine>`
<b>3.</b> Declare it as a template:
```html
<template is=xr-engine-template>
  <!--
    WebXR site goes here.
    This is for cases where you have <script> tags in your HTML,
    which you want to load _inside_ the WebXR site as opposed to the top-level
    page that contains the <template> tag.
  -->
</template>
```
<b>4.</b> Programatically create an `xr-engine` element: `document.createElement('xr-engine');`<br/>
<b>5.</b> Construct an instance of `XREngine`:
  ```html
  const xrEngine = new XREngine();
  xrEngine.innerHTML = '<xr-site></xr-site>';
  document.body.appendChild(xrEngine);
  xrEngine.enterXr();
  ```

------------------

Everything in `xr-engine` runs in an isolated `<iframe>` context, so the HTML code inside of `<xr-engine>` cannot see the top `window`.

For example, this does *not* work:

```html
<script>
  window.foo = 'bar';
</script>
<template is=xr-engine-template>
  <script>
    console.log('foo:', foo); // ReferenceError: foo is not defined
  </script>
</template>
```

That also means if you want to inline `<script>` tags and other resources in your `<xr-engine>` declaration, you should to use the `<template is=xr-engine-template>` variant which uses the standard [HTML Template Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template). This tells the browser to _**not**_ immediately run your code as it's parsed, which is the default behavior.

When you enter WebXR (or WebVR) inside of `xr-engine`, it will attach to the _virtual_ VR device of the engine.

You can use any WebXR/WebVR framework like `A-Frame` to perform this bootstapping, but Exokit Web 2.0 offers an even simpler way with `<xr-site>`.

------------------

## <xr-site>

This is the second new tag introduced in Exokit Web 2.0. `<xr-site>` represents the contents of your WebXR site, and its effect is to bind your virtual world to the hardware device.

```html
<xr-site camera-position="0 1.6 3">
  <xr-iframe src="webxr-site.html"></xr-iframe>
</xr-site>
<script>
const xrSite = document.querySelector('xr-site');
xrSite.cameraPosition = [1, 1, 1];
const session = await xrSite.requestSession(); // get the WebXR session that xr-site auto-created
xrSite.layers.push(canvas); // add a locally-rendered WebGL canvas (such as from THREE.js) as an additional layer
</script>
```

`xr-site` handles the work of setting up a WebXR session for your site. `xr-site` is optional; you can still make the WebXR session yourself, or have that handled by your WebXR framework such as THREE.js, A-Frame, or Babylon.js.

(Psst: if you write a component that does this, we would love it if you submitted it as a PR to [https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit-web](our GitHub repo)!)

------------------

## <xr-iframe>

`xr-iframe` represents a layer of reality rendered in the virtual world. This component was introduced in Exokit Web 1.0, and its role remains the same.

However, `xr-frame` has a new magical feature in Exokit Web 2.0: when you attach it to `xr-site`, it will automatically become a layer in the WebXR session. ðŸ˜®

As always, `xr-iframe` can be offset and transformed in the world with HTML attributes, which you can change from Javascript:

```html
<xr-iframe src="webxr-site.html" position="0 1.6 0" orientation="0 0 0 1" scale="3 3 3"></xr-iframe>
...
xrIframe.position = [-1, 3, -1];
...
```

# New boilerplate

Putting it all together, here is the full code needed to set up your own WebXR site:

## index.html
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
  <script type=module src="https://web.exokit.org/ew.js"></script>
  <xr-engine>
    <xr-site>
      <xr-iframe src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/exokitxr/webxr-samples/8a13dcbb22fa52feadfab7b7f41f85bdb3601a3f/xr-presentation.html"></xr-iframe>
    </xr-site>
  </xr-engine>
</body>
</html>
```

<sup>*Look ma, no code!*</sup>


## sw.js
The service worker loaded by the browser points to use Exokit Web's `sw.js`.

```js
importScripts('https://web.exokit.org/sw.js');
```

# Cross-origin setup

To access web origins Exokit Web can use a proxy. This requires setting an API key.

*note: you do not need an API key to [access the proxy on localhost via dev.exokit.org](https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit-web/blob/master/index.js#L11-L17).*
## 1. Get an API key

API keys are used to whitelist your domain on the proxy, and are free. Get one in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zgYEJgS).

## 2. Add API key

Add your API key to your Exokit Web import:

```html
<script type=module src="https://web.exokit.org/ew.js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"></script>
```
